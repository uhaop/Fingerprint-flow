backup_path: "~/Music/Music Library Backups"  # Where originals are backed up

# --- File Organization ---
# Available variables: {artist}, {album}, {year}, {disc}, {track}, {title}
# Multi-disc albums automatically get a "Disc N" subfolder.
folder_template: "{artist}/{album} ({year})"  # Folder structure template
file_template: "{track:02d} - {title}"         # File naming template
singles_folder: "Singles"                       # Folder name for tracks without an album
move_unmatched: false                          # If false (default), unmatched files stay in place
                                               # and a report is generated. If true, they are moved
                                               # to the unmatched_folder.
unmatched_folder: "_Unmatched"                 # Only used if move_unmatched is true

# Used as primary metadata source for known collections (e.g. DJ Screw),

# No API key needed.

# --- Processing ---
# Number of parallel fingerprint workers. Set to 0 or omit for auto-detect
# (half of your CPU cores). Higher values = faster fingerprinting but more
# CPU usage. fpcalc is a subprocess, so threads don't hit the GIL.
# Examples: 4 for a quad-core, 6 for a 6-core/12-thread CPU.
# max_concurrent_fingerprints: 6
batch_size: 50                  # Files per processing batch
